# Regular ZealOS programs on ARM64

The desktop, compiler and installer milestones do not establish that every
regular ZealOS application works. Programs are imported from the same public
ZealOS commit as the system sources:
`eee210f4379ba3d00b47507f336a158eefb2c993`. Exact file hashes are recorded in
`upstream/pinned/UPSTREAM.json` and verified by `make check-upstream`.

## Unchanged graphics programs

The source bundle now contains these original files, with no program edits:

| Program | Launch from a graphical terminal | Exit |
|--|--|--|
| Net of Dots | `#include "/Demo/Graphics/NetOfDots"` or Apps → Net of Dots | Press a character key at PRESS A KEY |
| Lines | `#include "/Demo/Graphics/Lines"` or Apps → Lines | Press a character key or Escape |
| Doodle | Apps → Doodle | Escape |
| Mass Spring | Apps → Mass Spring | Return resets; Escape exits |
| Game of Life | Apps → Game of Life | Escape |
| Digital Logic | Apps → Digital Logic | Press a character or Escape after the circuit is drawn |

`make check-stock-programs` runs both through the graphical terminal with
UTM's NEC USB controller model. It checks actual menu selection, visible
drawing/animation, removal of previous document text, key exit, a working
prompt afterward and signed integer intrinsic boundary cases. The alternate
VirtIO input path is checked with:

```sh
python3 scripts/check-compat.py --pci --probe-stock-programs
```

`make check-stock-interactive` exercises Doodle's original color picker and
retained thick stroke, Mass Spring's mouse placement, spring creation, moving
masses and reset, and Life's drawing and background evolution. It also checks
that Escape restores a working terminal and that one actual pointer click
delivers exactly one down and one up. These three Apps entries select a light
task surface so the original black ink remains visible. Their upstream source
files are unchanged. The same checks can use VirtIO input with:

```sh
python3 scripts/check-compat.py --pci --probe-stock-interactive
```

The fan must remain visible in its own window across compositor redraws and
clear on exit. Lines must produce changing colored pixels inside that same
window. Red text in another terminal, menu changes and cursor blinking do not
satisfy those checks. The runtime keeps the upstream foreground (`gr.dc`)
separate from the compositor target (`gr.dc2`) so immediate-mode program
drawing can persist while the desktop refreshes.

The old `netdots`/`lines` bring-up commands use separately adapted legacy
sources. They are not the unchanged programs above. This gate covers drawing,
input and normal exit, not pixel-for-pixel graphics parity or arbitrary
application compatibility. Doodle, Mass Spring and Life also pass live UTM
drawing/input, simulation, reset where applicable, and Escape-to-terminal
checks on ISO `3b59782c…`. Physical Pi acceptance remains separate.

## Digital Logic and embedded resources

`make check-logic-program` runs the original `/Apps/Logic/Run.ZC` from the Apps
menu with NEC USB input. The same test also passes with VirtIO input:

```sh
python3 scripts/check-compat.py --pci --probe-logic-program
```

The gate compares all ten original gate bitmaps against their saved pixels,
checks the original AND solver, then types through the actual application
prompts and checks the visible circuit, Escape, window restoration and a
subsequent `6*7;` answer. It then reopens Logic, solves an OR circuit and checks
that the gate changes and exits cleanly again. It also verifies visible
Backspace/forward Delete and middle-of-line edits, malformed numeric input
recovery, all three missing-value aborts and Shift+Escape. Each exit must
restore terminal geometry, remove the drawing callback and accept `40+2;`.
Live UTM confirmed the AND
circuit, but the initial `804f42c2…` image failed prompt-editing/abort checks:
Backspace left stale text and an early abort reached an unimplemented
`PutExcept`. On 2026-10-26 the user confirmed the requested corrected-image
retest works. The new screenshot confirms the expected AND circuit; prompt
editing, setup cancellation and terminal recovery are accepted by user report.
See [the live acceptance record](docs/acceptance/utm-logic-prompt-fix-2026-10-26.json).
The accepted program-test ISO is `build/zealos-aarch64-logic-prompt-fix.iso`
(`9c5e90c9…`), also promoted to `build/zealos-aarch64-hello.iso`. It can run the
program directly from its USB CD without installation.
For the small live example, enter `AND`, Return, then another Return to finish
the gate list. Enter `0x10` for table size; inputs `0xC`, `0xA`, then an empty
line; output `0x8`, then an empty line. The result is a two-input AND gate.
During setup, Shift+Escape returns an empty value. At the table-size prompt
this aborts setup; at an input/output prompt an empty value finishes that list.
Plain Escape exits the circuit view, but does not cancel a setup prompt in the
original document reader.

Nested source includes now use the same DolDoc reader as `ExeDoc`. They retain
embedded binary constants after an include reaches EOF and close owned
documents on normal completion and compiler recovery. The common document
loader recovers the UTF-8 representation of CP437 binary tails found in 54
pinned Apps/Demo documents; it preserves native packed files and source text.
The bitmap writer, size reader and renderer use the original packed 17-byte
bitmap header and preserve transparent pixels. This does not establish support
for every other serialized sprite opcode.

`make check-doc-bytes` checks exact resource decoding and malformed inputs.
`make check-doc-includes` checks saved binary documents, relative nested
includes, file/line provenance, constant lifetime, catchable malformed data and
repeated failed compilations without managed-memory growth. Application source
should use the graphical terminal's normal `#include`/`ExeFile2` path; the
bootstrap `zload` command does not itself decode a DolDoc root file.

## Remaining collection

An inventory of the pinned upstream `src/Apps` and `src/Demo` tree contains
294 files, including source, documents and binary resources. That is a file
count, not a count of applications. The ARM64 source bundle now ships that
complete tree, unchanged and hash-checked. Availability does not establish
compilation or runtime support.

The full application directories still need individual acceptance:
Budget, GrModels, KeepAway, Psalmody, Span, Strut, TimeClock, Titanium,
ToTheFront, Vocabulary and X-Caliber. The wider demo/game collection includes
Chess, Varoom, FlapBat and many others that have not been accepted on ARM64.
Some depend on missing sound, graphics, document, task or hardware behavior;
the assembly demos also require architecture-specific implementations.

`make check-program-catalog` compiles each application entry point in an
isolated guest task with `CCF_JUST_LOAD` and records the first blocker in
`build/program-catalog.json`. This is an inventory, not execution acceptance.
The remaining blockers include missing controls and graphics types, date/time
globals and dictionary/audio services. Budget and Vocabulary compile; their
runtime behavior is untested. Logic has the separate execution gate above.

| Application | First compile blocker in the inventory |
|--|--|
| Budget | Compiles after `no_warn` support; date, forms and save/reopen need runtime acceptance |
| GrModels | `sprite_elem_base_sizes` |
| KeepAway | `SpriteInterpolate` |
| Logic | Passes focused NEC/VirtIO execution gates and the user-confirmed live UTM retest on `9c5e90c9…` |
| Psalmody | `GodWordStr` (audio also remains unimplemented) |
| Span, Strut | `CCtrlBttnState` |
| TimeClock | Unbound `local_time_offset` |
| ToTheFront | `DCOS` |
| Titanium | `Sprite3Mat4x4B` |
| X-Caliber | `best_score` |
| Vocabulary | Compiles only; dictionary and audio need runtime acceptance |

For each program, track original-file integrity separately from compilation,
visible behavior/input, clean exit and any save/reboot/reopen requirements.
Merely copying an upstream file into the image does not make it supported.
Detailed passing runs and limitations belong in [ACCEPTANCE.md](ACCEPTANCE.md).
